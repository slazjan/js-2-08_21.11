'Yes.' He hunkered down and brought out his makings. Zoltan launched himself from Brown's head and landed, flittering, on the gunslinger's shoulder.
'After the other one, I guess.'
'Yes.' The inevitable question formed in his mouth:
'How long since he passed by?'
Brown shrugged. 'I don't know. Time's funny out here. More than two weeks. Less than two months. The bean man's been twice since he passed. I'd guess six weeks. That's probably wrong.'
'The more you eat, the more you toot,' Zoltan said.
'Did he stop off?' the gunslinger asked.
Brown nodded. 'He stayed supper, same as you will, I guess. We passed the time.'
The gunslinger stood up and the bird flew back to the roof, squawking. He felt an odd, trembling eagerness. 'What did he talk about?'
Brown cocked an eyebrow at him. 'Not much. Did it ever rain and when did I come here and had I buried my wife. I did most of the talking, which ain't usual.' He paused. and the only sound was the stark wind. 'He's a sorcerer, ain't he?'
'Yes.'
Brown nodded slowly. 'I knew. Are you?'
'I'm just a man.'
'You'll never catch him.'
'I'll catch him.'
They looked at each other, a sudden depth of feeling between them, the dweller upon his dust-puff-dry ground, the gunslinger on the hardpan that shelved down to the desert. He reached for his flint.
'Here.' Brown produced a sulfur-headed match and struck it with a grimed nail. The gunslinger pushed the tip of his smoke into the flame and drew.
'Thanks.'
'You'll want to fill your skins,' the dweller said, turning away. 'Spring's under the eaves in back. I'll start dinner.'
The gunslinger stepped gingerly over the rows of corn and went around back. The spring was at the bottom of a hand-dug well, lined with stones to keep the powdery earth from caving. As he descended the rickety ladder, the gunslinger reflected that the stones must represent two years' work easily—hauling, dragging, laying. The water was clear but slow-moving, and filling the skins was a long chore.
While he was topping the second, Zoltan perched on the lip of the well.
'Screw you and the horse you rode in on,' he advised.
He looked up, startled. The shaft was about fifteen feet deep: easy enough for Brown to drop a rock on him, break his head, and steal everything on him. A crazy or a rotter wouldn't do it; Brown was neither. Yet he liked Brown, and so he pushed the thought out of his mind and got the rest of his water. What came, came.
When he came through the hut's door and walked down the steps (the hovel proper was set below ground level, designed to catch and hold the coolness of the nights), Brown was poking ears of corn into the embers of a tiny fire with a hardwood spatula. Two ragged plates had been set at opposite ends of a dun blanket. Water for the beans was just beginning to bubble in a pot hung over the fire.
'I'll pay for the water, too.'
Brown did not look up. 'The water's a gift from God. Pappa Doc brings the beans.'
The gunslinger grunted a laugh and sat down with his back against one rude wall, folded his arms and closed his eyes. After a little, the smell of roasting corn came to his nose. There was a pebbly rattle as Brown dumped a paper of dry beans into the pot An occasional tak-tak-tak as Zoltan walked restlessly on the roof. He was tired; he had been going sixteen and sometimes eighteen hours a day between here and the horror that had occurred in Tull, the last village. And he had been afoot for the last twelve days; the mule was at the end of its endurance.
